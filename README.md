# [WHAT AT THE END] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [SYNTAX ERROR]


### Team Members

### Project Description
what at the end is a web app that lets users search for movies and find out if they have a happy, sad, or twist/cliffhanger ending.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Some people love suspense ‚Äî others can‚Äôt stand it. For the second group, watching a movie can feel like emotional torture because they spend the whole time wondering, ‚ÄúWill this end happily, or am I about to emotionally collapse?‚Äù My project solves this totally unnecessary but oddly relatable ‚Äúproblem‚Äù by letting users search a movie and instantly find out if it ends happily, sadly, or with a twist. Because sometimes, peace of mind is more important than plot twists.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
By building the internet‚Äôs most spoiler-friendly movie tool. You type in a movie name, and bam! ‚Äî we tell you if it‚Äôs üòÉ Happy, üò¢ Sad, or üò≤ Twist/Cliffhanger, and also the depth spolier in high mode without making you sit through 2 hours of emotional uncertainty. It‚Äôs like having a friend who spoils just enough so you can watch without anxiety‚Ä¶ or skip it entirely.
